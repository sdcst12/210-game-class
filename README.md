## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment 210 Creating a Game

The hardest part of incorporating a class is adding all the parts together and thinking in terms of objects rather than individual functions.  In many ways, it's a lot like making the jump from one large main block to making your program more modular and using function calls.

Today, we will be trying to extend how we think about classes and objects to build a game.  Some suggestions (and you can do multiple games for practice):

* rock-paper-scissors (or the hilarious rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock)
* craps (the hilarious game of betting on dice)
* blackjack (the hilarious casino card game)

** Important!
The main block of your program can only consist of the code that instantiates your object.  All of your program must be contained within the class template.

Assessment:
You will be graded on the following criteria:
* use of class properties (variables)
* appropriate use of local variables ( in class methods/functions)
* modularity (breaking up the main code into appropriate class methods/functions
* presentation (appearance, grammar, spelling)
* bulletproofing (preventing the program from crashing on bad input)
